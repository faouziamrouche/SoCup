# SoCup
An eco-friendly solution to replace paper cups by reusable, tracable, identifiable cups.

## How ?
1. Every reusable cup contains a unique ID, machine-readable via RFID/NFC
2. Cup and customer are paired :
    1. Through customer card at PoS
    2. Manually via end-user app (screenshot above)
3. Enjoy coffee
4. Throw the cup into any of the coffee cup bins along the train platform (it is scanned afterwards)

## Why ?
1. Saves lots of valuable material
2. Keeps train stations clean
3. Provides customer payback programs
4. Generates unique insights for SBB and coffee vendors
